    <h1> *JS Q&A Function*</h1>
    <hr>

    <div>Q1.Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement;</div>
    <div id="zero">→ value printed in console At line no.5</div>
    <hr>

    <div>Q2.Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and print the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7"</div>
    <div id="zero">→ value printed in console At line no.14</div>
    <hr>

    <div>Q3. Create one arrow function</div>
    <div id="zero">→ value printed in console At line no.19</div>
    <hr>

    <div>Q4."Print output: 
       <pre> var x = 21;
        var girl = function () {
            console.log(x);
            var x = 20;
        };
        girl ();"</pre></div>
    <div><span id="output">→ [Output:Undefined].</span><span id="zero">value printed in console At line no.24</span></div>
    <div>
        Reason: The output value is Undefined because when the execution context was running ,before it could 
        assign value to x, the x was called(console.log x). 
    
    <hr>

    <div>Q5. "Print output: 
        <pre>var x = 21;
        girl ();
        console.log(x)
        function girl() {
            console.log(x);
            var x = 20;
        };"</pre></div>
    <div>→<span id="output">[Output:21].</span><span id="zero"> value printed in console At line no.32</span><div>
        Reason: In the process of process of memory allocation the function was skipped after var x = 21, and then
        there was console.log(x), So the execution context took the first declared value of x and printed in the output.
    </div></div>
    <hr>

    <div>Q6. "Print output
        <pre>
       
    var x = 21;
    a();
    b();

    function a() {
    
    x = 20;
    console.log(x);
    };
    function b() {
    
        x = 40;
    console.log(x);
    };"
    </pre></div>
    <div><span id="output">→[Output:21,20,40].</span><span id="zero">value printed in console At line no.32,47 and 52</span></div>
    <div>Reason: In the M.A execution context the x value printed as 21, then in the a function where the x was 
        declared 20 before console.log(x) so the after execution of function scope the value of x which was 20 
        and it was near so it printed x = 20. Same with the case of 40.
    </div>

    <div>Q7.Write a function that accepts parameter n and returns factorial of n</div>
    <div><pre>function factorial(n) {
        if (n === 0) return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
      }
        let num = 6;
      console.log(factorial(num))</pre></div>
      <div id="zero">→ value printed in console At line no.62 i.e 720</div>
